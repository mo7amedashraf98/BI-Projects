# BI-Projects

Welcome to my **BI Projects** repository! This space is dedicated to showcasing the various data analysis and visualization projects I've completed using powerful BI tools like **Power BI** and **Tableau**. Each project demonstrates my ability to transform complex data into **insightful, actionable visuals** that drive informed decision-making. Whether you're exploring data trends or deep-diving into specific analyses, I hope these projects provide valuable insights and inspiration.

### 1. London Bike Share ([Link](https://github.com/mo7amedashraf98/London_bike_share))
This project is my first step into the world of BI & Tableau. In this project I Used Python for data exploration, manipulation, and preprocessing to clean and prepare the data for the visualization phase. Then I Used Tableauâ€™s different features such as set actions, user-defined parameters, and calculated fields to create an interactive dashboard that allows the user to have a closer look at the total number of rides, Temperature, and Wind Speed at a chosen time.

**Tools Used:** Python & Tableau

### 2. Data Professional Survey ([Link](https://github.com/mo7amedashraf98/Data-Professional-Survey))

This project marks my first step into the world of Power BI. I explored **Power Query** and **DAX** to clean and manipulate data, which are necessary for data analysis. Throughout the project, I created a variety of visualizations, including **heatmaps**, **bar charts**, **donut charts**, and **gauges**, to effectively summarize and present key insights. This experience not only introduced me to the powerful capabilities of Power BI but also enhanced my ability to turn raw data into meaningful visuals that drive decision-making.

**Tools Used:** Power BI


### 3. HR Dashboard ([Link](https://github.com/mo7amedashraf98/HR_Dasboard))
In this project, I took a deeper dive into Power BI by embarking on a fully self-guided project. I began with data cleaning and preprocessing using SQL before loading the data into Power BI. Within Power BI, I leveraged Power Query and DAX to calculate the necessary measures and columns for the analysis. Finally, I developed an interactive dashboard to showcase the findings, using a variety of visualizations such as donut charts, line charts, and bar charts.

**Tools Used:** SQL & Power BI


### 4. MGH Executive Dashboard ([Link](https://github.com/mo7amedashraf98/MGH-Executive-Dashboard))

In this project, I leveraged DAX expressions like CALCULATE, COUNTROWS, and AVERAGE to clean the data and create key measures essential for in-depth analysis. Additionally, I applied DAX functions for time series analysis, such as DATEDIFF, YEAR, and MONTH, to extract and compute date-related metrics and effectively filter the data. Finally, To present the findings, I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard featuring various visualizations, including donut charts, bar charts, and line charts, along with a filter feature to facilitate seamless navigation.

**Tools Used:** Power BI & DAX
